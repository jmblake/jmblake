ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Morgan!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m into Python, functional programming, all things data, and solving problems with beautiful code.

ðŸŒ± I usually work in Python, though spent a while using Scala.

ðŸ“« You can catch me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-blake-657871170/), or find out more on my [website](https://jmblake.github.io) (very much a work in progress).
