ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Morgan!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m into Python, functional programming, data cleansing through to visualisation, and solving problems through beautiful code.

ðŸŒ± I usually work in Python, though spent a while with Scala, from which I acquired a functional bent. 

ðŸ“« You can reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-blake-657871170/). You can also find out more on my [website](https://jmblake.github.io) (very much a work in progress).
