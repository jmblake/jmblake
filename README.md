ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Morgan!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m into Python, functional programming, all things data, and solving problems with beautiful code.

ðŸŒ± I usually work in Python, spent a while using Scala, and tinker with Rust in my spare time.

ðŸ“« If you'd like to connect, you can catch me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-blake-657871170/).
